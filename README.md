# Game of Life

This is another implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life.

## Introduction

This is a C implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The goal is to utilize
GTK's library to create a user interface. At a later date the code will be
extended to run a smaller map and control an LED matrix via an AVR
microcontroller.

## Disclaimer

This project has been undertaken to learn about and practice C programming, as
well as the use of GitHub.
Therefore there may be mistakes and bugs in the code. Use of the code or the
program is at the user's risk.
