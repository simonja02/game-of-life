Game of Life

This is another implementation of the famous Game of Life.

The core will be written in C and will be designed in such a way that it can be used with two different views with minimal changes.
One view will display the Game of Life on a computer screen using the GTK libraries.
The second view will come later and it, combined with the core, will be executed on an AVR microcontroller to control an LED matrix.
